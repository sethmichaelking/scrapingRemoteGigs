# scrapingRemoteGigs

This application is scraping data from a single job board. The goal is for it to scrape data from a few other source as well. 

Eventually, there will be basic UI that displays these jobs. For now I've got the server ready with the scraped data, but probably need it to run CRON jobs to get more data on a regular basis.
